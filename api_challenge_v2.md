# API Challenge

Design and create a production grade RESTful API that could be used to manage a list of TV shows.

# Requirements

The operations we expect to see would be:

* Create a show (id, title, description, duration, originalAirDate, rating, keywords)
* List all shows (bonus points for pagination and sorting)
* Update an existing show

# Data

Data should be persisted to some sort of a database. For the purpose of this challenge, an in-memory database is perfectly acceptable.

# Build, Deployment and Running

While this falls outside of the coding challenge, please consider the following as you get ready to discuss your solution with the team:

* How would you package this for deployment?
* How and where would you deploy this app?
* How can you tell that the app is up and running?
* How would you monitor the app in production?
* How would you configure the app as it goes from dev, to qa and finally to production?
* How would you insulate the app from a downstream API if it had one?

# Submission

The preferred method is a public GitHub repo but you may also send it in as a zip package. Either way, please include instructions on how to run the project.
